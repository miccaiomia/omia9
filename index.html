<h1>OMIA9: 9th MICCAI Workshop on Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis</h1>
<h2>Scope of the Workshop</h2>
Age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma are the main causes of blindness in both developed and developing countries. The cost of blindness to society and individuals is huge, and many cases can be avoided by early intervention. Early and reliable diagnosis strategies and effective treatments are therefore a world priority. At the same time, there is mounting research on the retinal vasculature and neuro-retinal architecture as a source of biomarkers for several high-prevalence conditions like dementia, cardiovascular disease and of course complications of diabetes.

Automatic and semi-automatic software tools for retinal image analysis are being used widely in retinal biomarkers research, and increasingly percolating into clinical practice. Significant challenges remain in terms of reliability and validation, number and type of conditions considered, multimodal analysis (e.g., fundus, optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy), novel imaging technologies, and the effective transfer of advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies, to mention a few. The workshop will address all these aspects and more, in the ideal interdisciplinary context of MICCAI.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
This workshop aims to bring together scientists, clinicians and students from multiple disciplines in the growing ophthalmic image analysis community, such as electronic engineering, computer science, mathematics, and medicine, to discuss the latest advancements in the field.

<h2>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to</h2>
Computer-aided detection and diagnosis of disease

Image analysis of novel ophthalmic imaging modalities

Multimodal ophthalmic image analysis

Ophthalmic image atlases

Ophthalmic image analysis in animals

Registration of ophthalmic images, including multimodal

Segmentation of structures (e.g., vasculature, lesions, landmarks)

Combined analysis of images of the eye and other organs

Validation

Crowd sourcing
